My paper, called "Leveraging the CARE Methodology to Enhance Pedagogical and Institutional Support for Blind or Low-Vision (BLV) Learners in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)," won the <b> Best Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Paper Award </b> at the 2024 American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Conference! I had an absolutely great time co-writing this work with Trisha Kulkarni and Sheri D. Sheppard.
