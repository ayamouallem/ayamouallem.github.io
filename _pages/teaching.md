At <b>Stanford University</b>, I have been fortunate to serve as a teaching assistant or primary instructor multiple classes across my discplines of interest: electronics, human-computer interaction, design, and engineering education. I adopt inclusive teaching pedagogy and frameworks in my course design and delivery. I also received the [Stanford Centennial Teaching Assistant Award](https://ctl.stanford.edu/centennial-teaching-assistant-awards) in 2024 in recognition of my teaching efforts. Beyond Stanford, I have taught and guest-lectured in <b>Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia</b>. Apart from teaching, I have served as a primary research mentor for seven undergraduate and graduate students at Stanford University and the American University of Beirut, many of whom I have co-authored publications with as well.
