At Stanford University, I have been fortunate to serve as a teaching assistant or primary instructor multiple classes across my discplines of interest: electronics, human-computer interaction, design, and engineering education. I adopt inclusive teaching pedagogy and frameworks in my course design and delivery. I also received the Stanford Centennial Teaching Assistant Award in 2024 in recognition of my teaching efforts. Beyond Stanford, I have taught and guest-lectured in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia.

Apart from teaching, I have served as a primary research mentor for seven undergraduate and graduate students at Stanford University and the American University of Beirut, many of whom I have co-authored publications with as well.
