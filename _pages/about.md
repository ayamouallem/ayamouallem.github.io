I'm a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering, minoring in Education, at Stanford University, advised by <b>Professor Sheri Sheppard</b>. I am interested in creating and sustaining inclusive pathways to engineering education for marginalized learners. My current research focuses on improving the accessibility of electronics-based education to learners who are blind or have low-vision by developing inclusive educational affordances, such as teaching frameworks and education technology. I generally conduct research at the intersection of engineering education, human-computer interaction (HCI), accessibility, and human-centered design, relying on a mix of qualitative and technical skills. I am funded and supported by the [Knight-Hennessy Scholars](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu) program, the [RAISE doctoral fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/RAISE), and the [DARE doctoral fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/dare).

In line with my academic work, I'm invested in scaling access to STEM literacy, especially in the Global South. Over the past few years, I have launched and led multiple award-winning initiatives and projects, including [All Girls Code](https://www.allgirlscode.me) and [LebNet Tech Fellows](https://lebnet.us/TechFellows). I have taught in the United States, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.
