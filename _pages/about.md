Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering, minoring in Education, at Stanford University. I am interested in creating and sustaining inclusive pathways to engineering education for marginalized learners, and I'm currently contributing to improving the accessibility of electronics-based education to learners who are blind or have low-vision, by developing inclusive educational affordances (teaching frameworks, education technology, etc.). I conduct research at the intersection of engineering education, human-computer interaction (HCI), accessibility, and human-centered design, relying on a mix of qualitative and technical skills, and I'm advised by <em>Professor Sheri Sheppard</em>. I am grateful for the funding and support that I receive through the [Knight-Hennessy Scholars](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu) program, the [RAISE doctoral fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/RAISE), and the [DARE doctoral fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/dare).

In line with my academic work, I'm invested in scaling access to STEM literacy, especially in the Global South. Over the past few years, I have launched and led multiple award-winning initiatives and projects, including [All Girls Code](https://www.allgirlscode.me) and [LebNet Tech Fellows](https://lebnet.us/TechFellows). I have also employed inclusive pedagogy in my teaching experiences in the US, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.
