I conduct research at the intersection of engineering education, human-computer interaction (HCI), accessibility, and human-centered design. I'm advised by *Professor Sheri Sheppard*, and my current research explores improving the accessibility of electronics-based engineering education to learners who are blind or have low-vision by developing inclusive educational affordances (teaching frameworks, education technology, etc.). I rely on a mix of qualitative and technical research skills to conduct my research. Iâ€™ve also spent a lot of time over the past few years advocating for equitable access to technology education by launching and leading multiple award-winning initiatives and projects, including [All Girls Code](https://www.allgirlscode.me) and [LebNet Tech Fellows](https://lebnet.us/TechFellows).
