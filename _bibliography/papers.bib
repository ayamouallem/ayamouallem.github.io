  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={In-memory computing is a promising candidate for overcoming the von Neumann memory wall and accelerating data processing in neural network applications. We propose a ITIR-based approach to carry out an efficient in-memory computation of the minimum logic function to be executed in the form of a series of 1-bit search operations similar to modern associative processors. We study the proposed design in the context of Kohonen Neural Networks that are also known as self-organizing maps. They are based on competitive learning where the minimum-search operation is a crucial part in the learning process. We study the trade off of different low-to-high resistance state windows associated with different endurance levels in the presence of process variations. We demonstrate ~0-4% reduction in the MNIST test dataset accuracy for the different scenarios. We report a maximum of 6fJ for the 1-bit search operation.},
